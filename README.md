#Task Manager

The project will have two main classes: buckets and lists.

A bucket is a collection of tasks, so the buckets will have a name, a description, a status and a number of tasks. A task will have a name, a description, a status and the bucket that it will belong to.

For example: I can have a bucket called "Party Preparation", the definition will be "List of things I have to buy for next week's party". And it can include tasks like: "Buy sauces" with a description similar to "Make sure that no sauce contains peanuts as my best friend is allergic".

The task status can be "Pending" or "Completed", whereas a bucket can be "Empty", "Pending" or "Completed".
